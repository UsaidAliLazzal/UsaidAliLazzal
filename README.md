### 👋 Hi, I’m Usaid Ali

I’m a **Software Test Engineer** with hands-on experience in **test automation**, **diagnostics**, and **system integration** within the automotive domain.  
Originally from Pakistan 🇵🇰 and now based in Germany 🇩🇪, I’m passionate about bridging manual and automated testing processes to build more reliable and efficient validation systems.

### 🚗 Professional Overview

I currently work at **EDAG Engineering GmbH**, where I develop and maintain **Python-based automation frameworks** to execute and validate automotive system test cases.  
My daily work involves:
- Converting **manual test cases** into **automated test sequences**  
- Working with **CAN/LIN communication**, **diagnostic protocols**, and **test benches**  
- Enhancing test efficiency through scripting, tooling, and process improvement  

Before joining EDAG, I completed my **Master’s Thesis** on the *Diagnostic Evaluation Tool for the ENNA Framework* — a prototype solution designed to evaluate diagnostic tests for infotainment systems.  
The project combined:
- A **C#-based GUI front-end**  
- A **PostgreSQL database backend**  
- Integration with an **automation framework** for diagnostic data processing
